Image Segmentation using Pytorch following U-Net Architecture

We will be usinng *cifar10*

Training an image classifier <br>
We will do the following steps in order: <br>

* Load and normalize the CIFAR10 training and test datasets using torchvision <br>
* Define a Convolutional Neural Network <br>
* Define a loss function <br>
* Train the network on the training data <br>
* Test the network on the test data
